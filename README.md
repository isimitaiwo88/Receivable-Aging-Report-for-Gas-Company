# Receivable-Aging-Report
Receivable Aging Report, i used excel to create an aging report, using DATEDIF to display the number days between the due date and the period ending, and then use AND and IF to compare number days to the date range and place the outstandings to the appropriate date range. this setup reduces workload and creation of new sheets.
the doc file "Receivable Aging Report README how it works" is included to explain the inner workings with images
and the xlxs file "Receivable Aging Report" is also included

*Disclaimer - These numbers arent real nor the Companies
